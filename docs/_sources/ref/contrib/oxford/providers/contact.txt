.. class :: molly.contrib.oxford.providers.ContactProvider

.. index ::
   pair: XML web-service; contact provider

This provider makes use of an IP-restricted service and is thus of little use
beyond providing insight into how to develop a contact provider.

.. class :: molly.contrib.oxford.providers.ScrapingContactProvider

.. index ::
   pair: screen-scraping; contact provider

This provider performs requests against the `University's contact search
<http://www.ox.ac.uk/applications/contact_search/>`_, extracting the results
from the returned HTML.

As results from the main site are already paginated in groups of ten, this
provider handles its own pagination.
