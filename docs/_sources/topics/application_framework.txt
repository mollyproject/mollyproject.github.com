The Application framework
=========================

Molly extends Django by formalising the concept of an application. This is
acheived by instantiating :class:`~molly.conf.settings.Application` objects
and adding then to :data:`~settings.APPLICATIONS` in your ``settings`` module.

This document explains how the Application framework works, and should not be
a necessary part of your reading unless you intend to write a new Molly
application, or have sufficient levels of curiosity.

If you don't know whether you want to write an application or a provider, the
following section may be useful. For information on writing providers, see
:doc:`topics/writing_providers`.

Difference between applications and providers
---------------------------------------------

Molly is intended to be relatively pluggable, allowing the deploying
institution to take whatever provided functionality they choose and, if
necessary, integrate it with their own applications.

This integration can be done at two levels, the application level, or the
provider level.

An application is a Python package, usually containing ``urls``, ``models``
and ``views`` modules. An application provides a data model and interface for
a particular class of information, for example, PC availability or lecture
timetables.

A provider is usually a single Python class that connects an application to a
data source. A provider might implement some well-known protocol or file
format (e.g. RSS for the feeds application), or might connect to a local
bespoke system.

It is intended that in the majority of cases the implementor should be able to
take an already-existing application and need only write the provider that
performs the interaction with other systems.

Overview of the Application framework
-------------------------------------

An :class:`~molly.conf.settings.Application` object is a wrapper around a
Python package which hooks in providers and configuration objects for easy
access by the application. The definition is as follows:

.. class:: molly.conf.settings.Application

   .. method:: __init__(application_name, local_name, title, **kwargs)

      Instantiates an Application object. None of the module or package paths
      are dereferenced yet. ``kwargs`` are mostly left alone and attached to
      the `~molly.conf.settings.ApplicationConf` class. Some, defined later,
      have special meanings.

      :param application_name: a Python package path to the application to be
          used, e.g. ``'molly.apps.places'``.
      :type application_name: str
      :param local_name: a local unique identifier for this instance of the
          :class:`~molly.conf.settings.Application`. In most cases this will
          be identical to the last part of ``application_name``. This will be
          used in almost all cases where an application needs to be referenced.
      :type local_name: str
      :param title: A descriptive title for the application instance to be
          shown to the user.
      :type title: unicode or str

   .. method:: get()

      Used internally. Creates a configuation object and dereferences all the
      paths provided to it. Where a ``urls`` module exists it will call
      :meth:`~molly.conf.settings.Application.add_conf_to_pattern` to walk the
      urlconf to attach the configuration object to the views.

      The ApplicationConf returned will have attributes reflecting the
      ``kwargs`` passed to :meth:`~molly.conf.settings.Application.__init__`.
      The urlconf will be exposed as a ``urls`` attribute.

      :rtype: ApplicationConf subclass

   .. method:: add_conf_to_pattern(pattern, conf, bases)

      Used internally. Maps the ``conf`` and ``bases`` onto the views
      contained in ``pattern``. This method creates a new view, with ``conf``
      in the class dictionary and the view and ``bases`` as base classes.
      Specifically::

         new_callback = type(callback.__name__ + 'WithConf',
                             (callback,) + bases,
                             { 'conf': conf })

      This dynamically creates a new class object. For more information, see
      the second definition of :func:`type`.

      When given a :class:`~django.core.urlresolvers.RegexURLPattern` it will
      return a new :class:`~django.core.urlresolvers.RegexURLPattern`
      with its callback replaced as above. When given a
      :class:`~django.core.urlresolvers.RegexURLResolver` it will descend
      recursively before returning a new
      :class:`~django.core.urlresolvers.RegexURLResolver` instance.

      :type pattern: RegexURLResolver or RegexURLPattern instance
      :type conf: ApplicationConf subclass
      :type bases: tuple of BaseView subclasses
      :returns: A copy of the first argument with views replaced as described
          above.
      :rtype: RegexURLResolver or RegexURLPattern instance

In the vast majority of cases, you will only need to use the constructor, and
only in your ``settings`` module.

There are a few keyword arguments with special meanings:

``providers``
    An iterable of :class:`~molly.conf.settings.Provider` instances to
    load providers from.
``provider``
    A shorthand for ``providers = [`provider`]``.
``display_to_user``
    A :class:`bool` used by :mod:`molly.apps.home` to determine whether a link
    should be rendered for the application on the home page.
``extra_bases``
    An iterable of :class:`~molly.conf.settings.ExtraBase` instances, defining
    extra base classes to add to all views in the application. With suitably
    defined extra base classes one can override functionality.
    Application-level authentication may also be added in this manner.
``secure``
    A :class:`bool` which if :const:`True` will add
    :class:`~molly.auth.views.SecureView` as a base class of all views in the
    application. :class:`~molly.auth.views.SecureView` forces all requests to
    be made over HTTPS, and provides a ``secure_session`` attribute on
    :class:`~django.http.HttpRequest` objects.
``urlconf``
    A module path to the ``urls`` module to use for this application. May be
    useful if an application uses a non-standard naming, or if you want to
    override the application-provided urlconf. If not provided, defaults to
    ``application_name + '.urls'``

Here's an example::

    APPLICATIONS = [
        # ...
        Application('example.apps.dictionary', 'dictionary', 'Dictionary',
            provider = Provider('isihac.providers.apps.dictionary.uxbridge'),
            max_results = 10,
        ),
        # ...
    ]

Here we want to use a dictionary application with at most ten results from the
Uxbridge English Dictionary. If we wanted to expose two different dictionaries
we may wish to do the following::

    APPLICATIONS = [
        # ...
        Application('example.apps.dictionary', 'uxbridge_dictionary', 'Uxbridge English Dictionary',
            provider = Provider('isihac.providers.apps.dictionary.uxbridge'),
            max_results = 10,
        ),
        Application('example.apps.dictionary', 'oxford_dictionary', 'Oxford English Dictionary',
            provider = Provider('oxford.providers.apps.dictionary.oed'),
            max_results = 20,
        ),
        # ...
    ]

Once hooked into the root urlconf, this would present two links on the home
page. Alternatively, if the ``example.apps.dictionary`` application supported
multiple providers, we could do this::

    APPLICATIONS = [
        # ...
        Application('example.apps.dictionary', 'dictionary', 'Dictionaries',
            providers = (
                Provider('isihac.providers.apps.dictionary.uxbridge',
                    slug='uxbridge',
                    title='Uxbridge English Dictionary'),
                Provider('oxford.providers.apps.dictionary.oed',
                    slug='oed',
                    title='Oxford English Dictionary'),
            ),
            max_results = 10,
        ),
        # ...
    ]

Of course, this assumes that the application knows to pick the ``slug`` and
``title`` from each of its providers. To determine the interface between
applications and providers, consult the application's documentation.

Providers
---------

A provider maps an external interface onto the model used by the application.

Most applications provide a ``providers.BaseProvider`` class which specifies
an interface to be implemented by a provider for that application.

Extra base classes
------------------



Batch jobs
----------

A provider can annotate methods to be included in a crontab using the
:meth:`molly.conf.settings.batch` decorator::

    @batch('%d 9 * * mon' % random.randint(0, 59))
    def import_data(self, metadata, output):
        # do stuff
        return metadata
